Syntia is a program synthesis based framework for deobfuscation. It uses instruction traces as an blackbox oracle to produce random input and output pairs. From these I/O pairs, the synthesizer learns the code's underlying semantic. 

The framework is based on our [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-blazytko.pdf):

```


# Usage

The `scripts` demonstrate the usage of the framework.

## Symbolic execution

To symbolically execute an instruction trace of an obfuscated expressions, use

```
python2 scripts/symbolic_execution.py samples/tigress_mba_trace.bin x86_64

```

In this example, the expression is obfuscated via Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA). The final result is stored in `EAX`.

## Random Sampling

`random_sampling.py` generates random I/O pairs for a piece of code. Its output is a JSON file. To sample 20 times, use 

```
python2 scripts/random_sampling.py samples/tigress_mba_trace.bin x86_64 20 mba_sampling.json
```

It can be specified if memory and/or register locations are inputs/outputs.

## Program Synthesis for Obfuscated Code

`sample_synthesis` uses the I/O samples and synthesizes the semantics of each input. It is possible to synthesize only specific outputs (e.g., `EAX`):

```
{
 "output": {
     "name": "EAX", 
     "number": 0, 
     "size": 32
 }, 
 "top_non_terminal": {
     "expression": {
         "infix": "((u32 * u32) + (u32 * 1))"
     }, 
     "reward": 1.0
 }, 
 "top_terminal": {
     "expression": {
         "infix": "((mem_0x2 * mem_0x0) + (mem_0x4 * 1))"
     }, 
     "reward": 1.0
 }, 
 "successful": "yes", 
 "result": {
     "final_expression": {
         "infix": "((mem_0x2 * mem_0x0) + (mem_0x4 * 1))", 
         "simplified": "((mem_0x2 * mem_0x0) + (mem_0x4 * 1))"
     }
 }
}
```

The MBA-obfuscated expressions is equivalent to `(mem_0x2 * mem_0x0) + mem_0x4`, where `mem_i` corresponds to the i-th memory read.

## Manual I/O Generation

If random sampling does not work, I/O pairs can be crafted with other methods, e.g., by changing and observing values in a debugger. We define each input and output as follows:

```
{
    "inputs": {
        "0": {
            "location": "mem0", 
            "size": "0x4"
        }, 
        "1": {
            "location": "mem1", 
            "size": "0x4"
        }
    },
    "outputs": {
        "0": {
            "location": "EAX", 
            "size": "0x4"
        }
    }, 
    "samples": [["0x2","0x6", "0xFFFFFFF9"],
                ["0x14e","0x213","0xFFFFFc2d"],
                ["0x3ed","0x2710","0xFFFFFBC8"]
                ]
}
```


Each list in `samples` defines the observed I/O pairs in one sampling step. Before synthesis, we use the script `transform_manual_sampling_io_pairs.py` to transform it into the same output form as the results of `random_sampling.py`.

```
python2 scripts/transform_manual_sampling_io_pairs.py manually_crafted.json sampling.json
```

The, we can synthesize it as usual and obtain

```
{
    "0": {
        "output": {
            "name": "EAX", 
            "number": 0, 
            "size": 32
        }, 
        "top_non_terminal": {
            "expression": {
                "infix": "(~ ((u32 + u32) ^ (u32 & u32)))"
            }, 
            "reward": 1.0
        }, 
        "top_terminal": {
            "expression": {
                "infix": "(~ ((mem0 + mem0) ^ (mem0 & mem0)))"
            }, 
            "reward": 1.0
        }, 
        "successful": "yes", 
        "result": {
            "final_expression": {
                "infix": "(~ ((mem0 + mem0) ^ (mem0 & mem0)))", 
                "simplified": "~(2*mem0 ^ mem0)"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## General Program Synthesis

`mcts_synthesis_multi_core.py` shows a basic usage of the synthesis algorithm. It can be used to test the synthesis of different expressions (which can be defined in `oracle`). Furthermore, it allows to test the synthesis behavior for different configuration parameters.

# Structure

Syntia's code is structured in three parts: symbolic execution of obfuscated code, generating I/O pairs from binary code and the program synthesizer.

## symbolic_execution

A wrapper around Miasm's symbolic execution engine. We use it to symbolically execute pieces of obfuscated code.

## kadabra

Kadabra is our a blanked execution framework which is built on top of Unicorn Engine. Besides others, it supports instruction tracing, enforcing execution paths and tracing memory modifications. 

## assembly_oracle
The assembly oracle utilizes binary code as a black box and generates I/O pairs for the synthesizer. It is built upon Kadabra.

## mcts

It is the the core of Syntia: Monte Carlo Tree Search based program synthesis. Given I/O pairs from the assembly oracle, the synthesizer finds semantically equivalent non-obfuscated code.

## utils

Provides basic functionality that is used across the different subprojects. Furthermore, it contains some code that illustrates the parsing and usage of the random sampling results for program synthesis.

# Setup

## Dependencies

The file `install_deps.sh` provides the build process of our dependencies. Major pars of our framework can be used without all dependencies. In particular, we use

- [Capstone disassembly framework](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone)( (used by our assembly oracle)
- [Unicorn CPU emulator framework](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn) (used by Kadabra and our assembly oracle)
- [Z3 theorem prover + python bindings](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) (used by our synthesizer for expression simplification)
- [Miasm](https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm) (for symbolic execution)

## Docker

We provide a Docker container that contains all dependencies (but not Syntia itself). To build it, use the following commands:

```
# build docker container
docker build -t <name of container> <directory with docker file>

# run docker container interactively
docker run -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

The containers superuser password is `root`.
